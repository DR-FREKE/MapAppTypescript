The goal of a type definition file is to help typescript understand how a third party javascript library works.
So there are some library that was written in javascript; actually alot and when we try to use this 
library, typescript does not actually understand how it works hence we'd need to install the type definition of that library.
Some library when install by default comes with their type definition and for those that don't, we'll need to search for their 
type definition and install them.

Also when writing html and typescript, when we have a global variable that holds the library we want to use 
for example, the javascript map api from google map; we use this library by putting the link/url in the script tag in our html file.
When we try to use an object from the library on the browser, it actually works fine compared to when we try to use it in our typescript
file then we seee an error telling us it doesn't understand. and that's because we'll need to add the type definition of the google javascript
map api to our package.json file by installing the type definition.

NOTE: It is not compulsory for our classes to implement the interface; it will work fine as long as the classes satifies the properties or method 
that the interface requires. It helps us put error in the right places and I kinda feel it much professional to write code this way i.e the classes
implementing the interface which actually forces us to have the properties and methods in our dependent classes [User class and Company class]
